# The Digital Embassy Frontend Exercise

My solution for the frontend exercise. I have used ParcelJS for bundling my code and compiling scss files.
The working code is in the src directory and the final output is in the build directory.

## Installation

Download the repository and run:

```
yarn install
```

or

```
npm install
```

To run the local development server:

```
yarn dev
```

or

```
npm run dev
```

This will serve a development version of the site at http://localhost:1234 from the dist directory. Changes made to the src directory will be automatically applied while running the dev script.

To build the site again after making changes, run:

```
yarn build
```

or

```
npm run build
```
